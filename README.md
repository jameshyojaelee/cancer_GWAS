Main R script with source code <br />
<br />

## Mutation_analysis
folder with all the mutation analyses using UBA2 gene knockout effect data. contains extra R file for each cancer cell line <br />
<br />

## Data set
all the data files are provided by Broad Institute's [DepMap Portal](https://depmap.org/portal/)

## UBA2 gene knockout effect across lineage 
### **The term lineage is used here to describe different cancer cell lines such as colorectal and pancreatic cancer.**

# 3. Sumoylation Inhibition using TAK-981
TAK-981 is a novel sumoylation inhibitor created by Takeda. It is allowed for lab uses and is currently going through human trials. 
>[Clinical Trials info](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03648372)
